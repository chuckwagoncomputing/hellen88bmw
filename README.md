Inspired by https://github.com/rusefi/hw_88_bmw

https://github.com/rusefi/hw_microRusEfi

We shall start from https://github.com/rusefi/hellen121vag but using https://github.com/rusefi/hw_88_bmw shape and pinout.

Plan:

1) merge https://github.com/rusefi/hellen121vag MCU stuff with shape of https://github.com/rusefi/hw_88_bmw

from https://github.com/rusefi/hw_88_bmw we keep
   1) outline
   2) ignition coil drivers (we actually add two more - hw_88_bmw was a 6 cylinder board, we make a 8 cylinder ECU)
   3) MAP sensor position
